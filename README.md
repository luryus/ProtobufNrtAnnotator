# ProtobufNrtAnnotator

Automatically adds nullable reference type (NRT) annotations to C# code generated by Grpc.Tools, since the upstream protoc compiler does not yet support them.

## Usage

Add the package to your project alongside `Grpc.Tools` and `Google.Protobuf`:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Google.Protobuf" Version="..." />
  <PackageReference Include="Grpc.Tools" Version="..." PrivateAssets="All" />
  
  <PackageReference Include="ProtobufNrtAnnotator" Version="0.1.1">
    <IncludeAssets>build</IncludeAssets>
    <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
  </PackageReference>
</ItemGroup>

<ItemGroup>
  <Protobuf Include="yourfile.proto" />
</ItemGroup>
```

The package automatically processes protobuf-generated C# files during build and adds appropriate nullability annotations.

## How It Works

ProtobufNrtAnnotator is an MSBuild task that runs after Grpc.Tools generates C# code from `.proto` files. It uses Roslyn to:

1. Parse the generated C# syntax tree
2. Analyze each property, field, and parameter using semantic information
3. Determine which reference types should be nullable based on protobuf semantics (e.g., message fields are nullable, but repeated fields and collections are not)
4. Rewrite the syntax tree with appropriate `?` annotations
5. Save the modified code back to the generated files

This ensures your generated protobuf code works seamlessly with C# nullable reference types enabled.
